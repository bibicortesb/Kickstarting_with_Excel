# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise will reach her fundraising goal soon and wants to have more information for decision making on her endeavour, Fever's play. This analysis,was based on historical data for Kickstarters projects. Especifically, the report will delimit the focus on theather plays and will adress two main concerns: Outcomes based on lauch dates and Outcome based on fundraising goals. 

### Purpose
The main porpuse is to show Louis (client) through data analysis how similar projects behaved so she can make informed decisions on lauching date and budget management based on historical information.  

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis began with observing the type of data contained in the data set. Cleaning it and making the calculations available in columns to perform the analysis with pivot tables.

The first challenge came when the dates where in a different format than the one excel recognizes. The data in this column had to be transformed. The second challenge was to correctly categorize data, into parent category and subcategory to later display adequately on pivot charts. The third challenge was to transform data into a useful indicator. A column labeled as average donation was created to know on average how much backers invested in the project.  By doing this, some errors appeared whith this calculation so debugging was necessary.

After data was clean and structured in columns, it could be used to feed two main pivot charts:
- Outcomes based on launch date.
- Outcomes based on goals.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 
In the line plot below, the outcomes of theather category are shown based on launch date.

According to the graph, the following conclusions can be drawn:
- The best month for launching is May and June. 
- August, October and December are the worst months to launch, the risk is the highest.  
- Only 37 of all projects were canceled. 
- Overall 61% of the projects were successful, 839 out of 1,369.



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In the following line plot, classes were formed out of delimited fundraising goals to show success, failure and cancellation rates of plays from the data set.

We can conlude that:
- The most succesful plays had a fundraising goal in the following intervals <1.0 K-4.9 K & 35.0 K-44.9 K.
- The lowest succesful rates were in projects with a goal between 25.0 K-34.9 K. 
- The greatest concentration of projects is located in the interval of 1.0K-4.9K with a high success rate of 73%. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

Additional tables--> Delimit projects in Great Britain

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
