# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise will reach her fundraising goal soon and wants to have more information for decision making on her endeavour, Fever's play.

Especifically, the report will delimit the focus on musicals and will adress two main concerns: Outcomes based on lauch dates and Outcome based on fundraising goals. 

### Purpose
The main porpuse is to show Louis (client) through data analysis how similar projects behaved so she can make informed decisions on lauching date and budget management based on historical information.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

Additional tables--> Delimit projects in Great Britain

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
